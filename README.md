Smart Box Storage System
Repository/content note: This repository currently contains a Java smart-box storage demonstration, not a Payroll Management System. The requested payroll source files (Employee.java, FullTimeEmployee.java, ContractorEmployee.java, Taxable.java, BonusCalculable.java, and PayrollSystem.java) are not present in the repository. This README describes the source code that is actually present and does not infer payroll features that are not implemented.

Project Description
This console application demonstrates Java generics through a simple storage-box scenario. A generic SmartBox<T> can store and display an object of a chosen type. The application lets the user create a medicine box or an electronics box, enter one item's details, and print the box information.

The project is suitable as a small introductory exercise in generic classes, object creation, console input, and overriding toString().

Objectives
Demonstrate a generic class that can hold different object types.
Model medicine and electronic-device items as separate classes.
Collect data from the user with Scanner.
Display stored item details through each object's toString() implementation.
Provide a repeating menu that continues until the user chooses to exit.
Technologies
Java — source code uses generics, classes, constructors, and console I/O.
JDK: The code uses language features available in Java 7 and later (including the diamond operator). A modern JDK is recommended.
NetBeans IDE — can be used to open and run the project as a Java application.
Project Structure
File / class	Purpose
DynamicSearch.java	Contains all classes for the demonstration: SmartBox<T>, Medicine, ElectronicDevice, and the application entry point ManualDailyLifeGenericApp.
SmartBox<T>	Generic storage box with a name, a displayed maximum-weight value, and a slot for one item of type T.
Medicine	Stores a medicine name and expiry-date string; formats these values in toString().
ElectronicDevice	Stores a device brand and warranty duration in months; formats these values in toString().
ManualDailyLifeGenericApp	Contains main, the interactive menu, user input, object creation, and program exit handling.
There are no separate payroll classes or interfaces in the current repository. The source also has no separate Taxable, BonusCalculable, or Employee types.

How the Application Works
SmartBox<T> uses a type parameter T for its stored item. The application creates a SmartBox<Medicine> for medicine and a SmartBox<ElectronicDevice> for an electronic device. This allows the compiler to associate each box with the intended item type without requiring the program to cast the retrieved item.

Medicine and ElectronicDevice are independent classes; neither inherits from the other. Both override toString() so that SmartBox.printBoxDetails() can print their details using the common Object.toString() method.

The menu repeats inside a while (true) loop. Choosing option 3 prints a goodbye message and exits the loop. Other entered values are handled as invalid options.

Important Implementation Details
A box stores one item; calling storeItem assigns its item field.
The maximum-weight value is printed as box information only. The current code does not store or measure item weight, compare an item against the limit, or reject an item based on weight.
The expiry date and warranty are collected as strings/numbers and displayed. The source does not validate their format or business rules.
The interactive menu offers options for medicine, electronics, and exit.
Running the Program
The source declares public class ManualDailyLifeGenericApp, while the repository file is named DynamicSearch.java. Java requires a public top-level class to be in a file with the same name. Therefore, the source as currently named may not compile directly with javac or run as a standard NetBeans Java project.

To run it in a local working copy without changing this repository, first place the source in a file named ManualDailyLifeGenericApp.java, then:

Open NetBeans and create or open a Java application project.
Add ManualDailyLifeGenericApp.java to the project’s source package (or leave it in the default package, as in the current source).
Set ManualDailyLifeGenericApp as the main class if NetBeans does not detect it automatically.
Run the project and enter menu selections in the Output/console window.
Alternatively, compile and run from a terminal after the source file has the required filename:

javac ManualDailyLifeGenericApp.java
java ManualDailyLifeGenericApp
This README does not rename or modify any Java source file.

Example Interaction
The following is an illustrative run using the prompts and output strings in the source. User-entered values are shown after the prompts. The messages themselves are printed in Arabic by the application.

The example follows the prompts and formatting present in the source. The actual displayed text is Arabic; item values vary according to user input.

Java Concepts Demonstrated
Generic classes and type parameters: SmartBox<T> can be parameterized with different item types.
Encapsulation: class data is held in private fields and initialized through constructors.
Classes and objects: medicine, electronic-device, and box instances are created at runtime.
Constructors: initialize object state when instances are created.
Method overriding: Medicine and ElectronicDevice override toString().
Console input/output: Scanner reads user choices and item details; System.out prints prompts and results.
Control flow: a loop and conditional branches implement the menu and its options.
Null checking: the box checks whether it contains an item before printing its details.
Payroll Documentation Status
A Payroll Management System README describing tax rates, bonuses, employee types, or net-salary calculations cannot be written accurately from the current repository contents: none of the payroll source files listed in the request are present. Add or point to the intended payroll project/source files before documenting those rules.
